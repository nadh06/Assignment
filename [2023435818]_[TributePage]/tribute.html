        Ada Lovelace, born in 1815, was an English mathematician and writer, known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognize that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation and published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. Her most notable contribution came in 1843 when she translated and expanded upon an article by Luigi Menabrea about Babbage’s machine, adding her own extensive annotations—collectively known as the "Notes by the Translator." In these notes, particularly Note G, she described an algorithm for calculating Bernoulli numbers, which is now recognized as the first published computer program. Unlike Babbage, who focused on the engine’s computational abilities, Lovelace foresaw its potential to process symbols, music, and even art, making her one of the earliest thinkers to imagine computers as general-purpose machines.</p> 
        <p>Lovelace work introduced foundational concepts like loops and conditional logic, distinguishing between data and operations—ideas that would become central to modern programming.Her mindset of "poetical science" led her to ask questions about the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes), examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.Her mindset of "poetical science" led her to ask questions about the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes), examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool. As a result, she is often regarded as the first computer programmer.The programming language Ada is named after her.

      <p>Lovelace died at the age of 36 on 27 November 1852from cervical cancer (which contemporary accounts called uterine cancer, since a distinction between the two was not made at time). The illness lasted several months, in which time Annabella took command over whom Ada saw, and excluded all of her friends and confidants. Under her mother's influence, Ada had a religious transformation and was coaxed into repenting of her previous conduct and making Annabella her executor. She lost contact with her husband after confessing something to him on 30 August which caused him to abandon her bedside. It is not known what she told him.She was buried, at her request, next to her father at the Church of St. Mary Magdalene in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire.</p>
