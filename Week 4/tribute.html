      <p>
        Ada Lovelace, born in 1815, was an English mathematician and writer, known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognize that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation and published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is often regarded as the first computer programmer.
